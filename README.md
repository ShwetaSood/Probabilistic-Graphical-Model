Details of files
<ol type="1">
<li>BayesianNetwork_met.R - creating a Bayesian Network with Tabu Search and BDe (bayesian dirichlet equivalent) scoring function.
Model tries various permutations of adding and removing arcs, such that final network has maximum posterior probability distribution, starting from a prior probability distribution on the possible networks, conditioned on data.
</li>
<li>Data_preparation.R - Pre-processing and binning of data</li>
<li>MAP_Query.java - Select the target variableâ€™s Markov Blanket variables for which MAP values are to be computed. Run MAP query.
This query returns the value of the  selected variables such that the posterior probability of the evidenced target is maximized.
</li>
<li>cart_implement_metdata.R - Equivalent CART (Classification and Regression Trees) visualization of the data for comparison with Bayesian Network</li>
<li>shiny-demo/server.R - creates a server : upload .csv data file and visualize the Markov Blanket of a target variable</li>
<li>shiny-demo/ui.R - UI of the application</li>
<li>shiny-demo/Functions.R - all functions of the server</li>
